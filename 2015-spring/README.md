# Description
> Founded in 1919 as a course on War and Peace Issues, the central purpose of Contemporary Civilization is to introduce students to a range of issues concerning the kinds of communities – political, social, moral, and religious – that human beings construct for themselves and the values that inform and define such communities; the course is intended to prepare students to become active and informed citizens. While readings in this one-year course change from time to time, the factors that lead to adoption of a text always include historical influence, the presentation of ideas of enduring importance, and the demonstrated ability of a text to provoke productive discussion.

When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your fellow students, your
instructors, and to the research community at large. It wastes my time and
yours, and is, ultimately, not worth the risk. Consult Columbia’s guidelines at

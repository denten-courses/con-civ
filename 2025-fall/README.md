## Description

“Founded in 1919 as a course on War and Peace Issues, the central purpose of
Contemporary Civilization is to introduce students to a range of issues
concerning the kinds of communities--political, social, moral, and religious
--that human beings construct for themselves and the values that inform and
define such communities; the course is intended to prepare students to become
active and informed citizens. While readings in this one-year course change
from time to time, the factors that lead to adoption of a text always include
historical influence, the presentation of ideas of enduring importance, and
the demonstrated ability of a text to provoke productive discussion.”
